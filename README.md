# MobileNetV2_YOLOV3_ncnn
MobileNetV2_YOLOV3 for the ncnn framework

See https://qengineering.eu/opencv-c-examples-on-raspberry-pi.html for the Raspberry Pi implementation of this network <br/><br/>
To extract and run in Code::Blocks <br/>  <br/>
$ mkdir software/DeepLearning/MobiYO <br/>
$ cd software/DeepLearning/MobiYO <br/>
$ wget https://github.com/Qengineering/MobileNetV2_YOLOV3_ncnn/archive/master.zip <br/>
$ unzip -j master.zip <br/>
 <br/>
Your /home/pi/software/DeepLearning/MobiYO/ folder must now look like this <br/>
 <br/>

master.zip <br/>
mobilenet_yolov3.bin <br/>
mobilenet_yolov3.param <br/>
MobiYO.cpb <br/>
MobiYO.cpp <br/>
MobiYO.depend <br/>
README.md <br/>
 <br/>
Run MobiYO.cpb with Code::Blocks <br/>
You may delete master.zip as it is not needed any more.  <br/>
Remember, you need also have a working OpenCV 4 on your Raspberry.  <br/>
